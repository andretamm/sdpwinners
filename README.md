Team STABILITY
==========

Repository for team STABILITY (Group 1, 2014) for the System Design Project at the University of Edinburgh.

Running the code
==========
* On the computer side the strategy, communication and vision system are all started together by 2014SDP1/communication/StartRobot.java. This also starts the corresponding GUIs that make managing things easier

If you want to run the systems separately, then looking at that class will give you a good idea how to do it.


* On the NXT side all the files are in commNXTHolonomic. There are two separate packages for the defender and attacker robots. They are essentially the same, they just have different speeds for some movements and rotations due to the robots having different weight. The main classes are in NXT.java in both cases.

Everybody involved with the organisation of the SDP course, especially Garry Ellard, Paul Ardin and Henry S. Thompson.

Group 1 from 2013 (https://bitbucket.org/sdp_group1/sdp/) for the majority of our vision code and the basic framework for the communication system.
