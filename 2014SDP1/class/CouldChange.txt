-Raise or lower the blob size constant?
-Combine vision with a simulated guess - feed all motions into simulator, guess/predict where objects will be 
next, storing momentums. Average this guess location with the vision output, giving the simulation a larger
 weighting when vision is giving an erratic location? Sim should be given a weighting that is given a sudden boost when
 the vision gives an erratic/conflicting location, and then falls exponentially till boosted again? Implement simulator in
 'WorldState' class
